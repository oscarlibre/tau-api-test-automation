#### What is an API? 
- API stands for Application Programming Interface, which basically is one piece of code talking to another piece of code
  
#### Who is the end user of an API?
- The developers are the ones who are using the APIs to add functionality to their web pages, or their mobile applications etc.
  
#### Why is it important to test the API?
- That the APIs are correct, in that the contract is honored in the way that it's supposed to be.
- That they provide value, that they're doing something that the application needs.
- That they're intuitive. Basically, meaning that the API should be easy for a developer to work with.
  
#### How this works?
- First of all, you have a request, which includes an endpoint, method, headers and a body
- When the service receives this request, it responds with its own set of headers, body, and also a status code.
